## Paper Summary

An important component of this class is the reading of systems research papers.
To help you with this and to ensure we have a productive discussion in class,
you are required to write a concise summary for the required papers
<b>before</b> each class and submit the review through
[Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com).

We provided a [template](eecs582_review_summary.md) to help you write the
review. However, you do not have to follow the template. Regardless, your
review must summarize the key points and your thoughts. Be concise with the
review. Try to keep it in one page.

<span class="text-info">For Thursdays' classes, your reviews only need to answer 
the listed paper questions.</span>

We may include questions for some papers in the schedule page. In that case,
answer the questions in your review summary. 

If there are two or more required papers listed in one lecture, you are
required to write a review for at least *one paper*. Typically the first listed
paper will be discussed extensively, so we suggest you to write review for that
paper. You are encouraged to briefly compared and contrast that paper with the
others in your review. But note, this choice only applies to the review---you
must still **read all** the required papers. 


You are also welcome to include in your summary the questions that you would like to be 
discussed in class.

    <p>
    Your reviews should *not* copy-paste large chunk of the paper's descriptions.
    They must come from your own interpretation and thinking. We encourage you to 
    form a discussion/reading group to more effectively read the papers. But
    you should write the reviews independently.
    </p>

    <p>
    Copying reviews found on the Internet or from others is also disallowed. That
    will constitute a violation of the academic integrity policies and result in 
    serious consequences.
