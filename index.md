## Course Overview

Operating systems are a critical and complex piece of software that does the
heavy lifting of managing computing devices for other software. It is also one
of the few kind of software that has been extensively engineered, studied,
refined, debated, and even overhauled for over decades. While one might
consider operating systems as mature software, its evolution is far from
complete.

This course exposes students to the operating systems as a research field and
study operating systems, and more broadly computer systems in general, from a design 
point of view. We will examine different systems in both important historical 
context and recent research developments. In addition to teaching various system 
techniques, the objectives of the course also include helping students learn:

* How to read a research paper in an objective manner.
* How to write a critical analysis of the research described in a paper.
* How to articulate ideas and insights into a research paper.
* How to compare and contrast different approaches to understand their trade-offs.
* How to synthesize research themes and topics across multiple papers.

This course involves readings on classic and new papers. Topics include OS
structure and extension techniques, virtualization, synchronization,
communication, file systems, reliability, formal verification,
data centers, and history and experience of systems.

**Prerequisites**: EECS 482 (Introduction to Operating Systems) or equivalent.

## Readings
This course does not have a required textbook. However, it is useful to 
use an undergraduate operating systems textbook as a reference. 

The major material of the course comes from seminal, noteworthy, or representative 
papers from the literature. Each lecture will have one or two assigned papers 
to read. You **MUST**{: .text-danger} read the required papers **before**{: .text-danger} 
the class, and be prepared to discuss them. In-class questions or quizzes will 
confirm you do the reading.

For some topics, we will also list recommended papers. You are encouraged, 
but not required, to read those. Students often find it useful to form a reading 
group to discuss papers together before the class period, and we encourage 
the practice. The reading load will be heavy. So be sure to allocate enough
time for it.

* [Preliminary Reading List and Schedule](syllabus.html)

A helpful guide written by Bill Griswold on how to read and critique a research 
paper is linked [here](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/CSE210/howtoread.html).

## Reviews
You are required to submit a brief review for each lecture's required reading. 
The review must be turned in by <span class="text-danger">12pm</span> on the 
day of each lecture. Please read further [instructions](reviews.html) on the 
paper reviews.

## Class Participation
The structure of this course is unusual in that there are NO lectures or presentations 
during the class period. Instead, we will discuss research papers that we will 
have all read before each class period. Because of this format, class participation 
is vital to the success of the course. If you expect to just sit silently in the
class and learn, you will get little out of this course. 

I will lead the discussions for most of the lectures. I will ask direct 
questions about the paper and expect you to be able to answer. Note that your answers 
to these questions will be part of your overall grade. If you cannot do the reading 
for a particular class, *please let me know*{: .text-danger}. You are allowed 
**three** absences but you must still turn in the reviews before the next class. 

Some of the later lectures will be presented by students. One student will be
leading the discussion while the others participate. We will send the 
presentation schedule sign-up over email.

## Policies

* Reviews, if any, must be turned in before class.
* Three absences of classes are allowed for good reasons (e.g., conference presentation, 
interview). But reviews of the papers must be turned in.
* You are strongly encouraged to discuss the papers with other students in the class -- 
  you may have insights that others do not, and vice versa. Often students form reading groups, 
  which I heartily encourage. Note that group discussion, however, is not an effective 
  substitute for actually reading the paper.
* The course project is to be completed as a team. You can discuss project materials 
  with others in the course, but your code must have been authored exclusively by 
  members of your team. You **may not**{: .text-danger} copy code from another team 
  or make your code available to others.
* All students are required to know and adhere to the College of Engineering [Honor Code](https://ecas.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/02/College-of-Engineering-Honor-Code-UPDATED.pdf) and 
  university policies. Failure to do so will result in serious consequences outlined in the policy.
