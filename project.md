## Project

### Requirement
The reading assignments of the course expose you, the reader, to 
influential ideas in the design space of operating systems and help you learn 
to critique them. The other main component of the course is an open project that 
gives you the chance to switch roles to be the author: you propose an 
idea related to systems in general, motivate it, implement a prototype system that 
demonstrates its efficacy through experiments, and then write up a formal report 
that can convince others that it is a good idea. The project can be done in group 
of two students (or three if the amount of work is substantial). Please use
the [USENIX conference paper template](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates)
to format your report.

### Expectations
The best outcome for a project that is well done is that it can eventually be 
suitable for publication at some major systems conference. The minimum expectation
for the project is that it should at least be interesting: it could be directly 
motivated to tackle an existing important real-world problem, e.g., system 
misbehavior in cloud environment, it could be trying to measure and improve 
an existing system, especially ones that are discussed in class, or it 
could be some crazy idea that nobody believes will work (initially). In other 
words, even if the project may not yield a real publication, it should at least 
have some intellectual depth and research flavor that readers can learn something.

### Topics
I will provide some suggested topics, but you are encouraged to come up with
your own. I will meet with you several times during the semester to help you
refine the project scope.

### Deliverable #1: Proposal
In the proposal, briefly describe the following elements:

* what is the problem you plan to tackle
* why the problem is important or interesting
* what has been done about this problem
* why the current solution is insufficient
* what you plan to propose
* what are the objectives/expected outcomes
* what are the potential challenges
* what is the timeline to execute your project

The proposal should be around 2 pages and include your group member's name and email. 
The proposal only needs to be submitted by one of the group members.

### Deliverable #2: Checkpoint Report
In the middle of the semester, submit a checkpoint report (around 3 pages) 
to describe the status of your project, the solution you have build so far, 
some initial results, new challenges that arise but did not anticipate, 
any adjustments to your approach or plan.

### Deliverable #3: Final Report
The final report should look like a research paper. It motivates the importance 
of the problem you are tackling, potentially with some concrete evidence or data 
points, and why existing solutions do not solve the problem well. Then describes 
what are you proposal, what challenges you need to address, how do you address 
them, why your idea is better, what are your system design and implementation. 
Then shows the experiment results, interpret the results, describe the 
observations and implications, conclude whether or how the results demonstrate
your solutions' superiority over state-of-the-art solution. Lastly, include
a brief related work section to compare and contrast with your solution.

There are no hard restrictions on the page limit on the final report because papers 
do not need to be long to be good. But your final report must comprehensively 
cover all the points mentioned above. The rule of thumbs is that when it does so, 
the report is around 6 to 10 pages.

### Deliverable #4: In-Class Presentation
Each project team will be given a slot to do a presentation in class to show
the cool ideas and results to other students. A live demo of the system
you developed would be a nice element of the presentation.

### Deliverable #5: Source Code
You will be required to turn in your source code and any documentation for grading.
