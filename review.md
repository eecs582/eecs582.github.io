## Paper Review

An important component of this class is the reading of systems research papers.
To help you with this and to ensure we have a productive discussion in class,
you are required to write a concise summary for the required papers
<b>before</b> each class and submit the review through
[Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com).

We provided a [template](eecs582_review_summary.md) to guide you in writing the
review. However, you are not required to follow the template. Regardless, your
review must summarize the key points and your thoughts. Be concise with the
review. Try to keep it in one page.

We may include questions for some papers in the schedule page. In that case,
answer the questions in your review summary. <span class="text-info">For Thursdays' 
classes, your reviews only need to answer the listed paper questions.</span>

If there are two or more required papers listed in one lecture, you are
required to write a review for at least *one paper*. Typically the first listed
paper will be discussed extensively, so we suggest you to write review for that
paper. You are encouraged to briefly compared and contrast that paper with the
others in your review. But note, this choice only applies to the review---you
must still **read all** the required papers. 


You are also welcome to include any questions you would like to see discussed 
in class within your review.

    <p>
    Your reviews should <i>not</i> copy-paste large chunk of the paper's descriptions.
    They must come from your own interpretation and thinking. We encourage you to 
    form a discussion/reading group to more effectively read the papers. But
    you should write the reviews independently.
    </p>

    <p>
    Copying reviews found on the Internet or from others is strictly prohibited. That
    will constitute a violation of the academic integrity policies.

    You may use tools such as ChatGPT to help you understand a paper. However, you 
    are not allowed to use them to generate paper reviews for you.
