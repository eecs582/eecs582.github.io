<b>End-to-end argument</b>
<div class="well paper-question">

  functions in the low levels of a system like communication more reliable?
</p>
<p>
Q2: Give an example that you can think of or have encountered where the

<b>THE</b>
<div class="well paper-question">
Q: Dijkstra explicitly states their goals for the THE operating system. How do these goals compare to, say, Microsoft's goals for the Windows operating system? Why do we no longer build operating systems with the same goals as THE?

<b>Xen</b>
<div class="well paper-question">
Q: Microkernels and virtual machine monitors are two different ways to support the execution of multiple operating systems on modern hardware. How does the microkernel approach in L4 compare and constrast with the VMM approach in Xen?

<p>
<b>Scheduler Activations</b>
<div class="well paper-question">
Q: The goal of scheduler activations is to have the benefits of both user and kernel threads without their limitations. What are the limitations of user and kernel threads, and what are the benefits that scheduler activations provide?

<div class="well paper-question">
Q: At a high level, as a mechanism how does lottery scheduling provide modular resource management? Why can't the Unix scheduler provide a similar kind of management?
