        <h2 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h2>

<p>Operating systems are a critical and complex piece of software that does the
heavy lifting of managing computing devices for other software. It is also one
of the few types of software that has been extensively engineered, studied,
refined, debated, and even overhauled for decades. While one might
consider operating systems as mature software, its evolution is far from
complete.</p>

<p>This course exposes students to the operating systems as a research field and
study operating systems, and more broadly computer systems in general, from a design 
point of view. We will examine different systems in both important historical 
context and recent research developments. In addition to teaching various system 
techniques, the objectives of the course also include helping students learn:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to read a research paper in an objective manner.</li>
  <li>How to write a critical analysis of the research described in a paper.</li>
  <li>How to articulate ideas and insights into a research paper.</li>
  <li>How to compare and contrast different approaches to understand their trade-offs.</li>
  <li>How to synthesize research themes and topics across multiple papers.</li>
</ul>

<p>This course involves readings on classic and new papers. Topics include OS
structure and extension techniques, virtualization, synchronization,
communication, file systems, reliability, formal verification,
data centers, and history and experience of systems.</p>

<p><span class="badge bg-info md-badge">Prerequisite</span>: EECS 482 (Introduction 
to Operating Systems)* or equivalent.</p>

<h2 id="readings">Readings</h2>
<p>This course does not have a required textbook. However, we recommend you to
use an undergraduate operating systems textbook as a reference, e.g., 
<a href="http://www.ostep.org">Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces</a>.</p>

<p>The major material of the course comes from seminal, noteworthy, or representative 
papers from the literature. Each class will have one or two <strong>required</strong> papers 
to read. You <strong class="text-danger">MUST</strong> read the required papers <strong class="text-danger">before</strong> 
the class, and be prepared to discuss them. In-class questions or quizzes will 
confirm you do the reading.</p>

<p>For some topics, we will list additional recommended papers. You are encouraged, 
but not required, to read those. Students often find it useful to form a reading 
group to discuss papers together before the class period, and we encourage 
the practice. The reading load will be heavy. So be sure to allocate enough
time for it.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="schedule.html">Reading List and Schedule</a></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="badge bg-info md-badge">Note</span>: this course assumes that you
have taken the undergraduate operating systems course. Thus, it will <em>not</em>
cover background knowledge such as how virtual memory works. Most papers we will 
read also make such an assumption. If you did not take an undergraduate OS 
course, it will be quite challenging to complete this course. If your undergraduate 
OS knowledge is rusty, review past lectures (<a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ryanph/jhu/cs318/fall22/schedule.html">example</a>) to
help better comprehend the papers.</p>

<h2 id="structure-and-policies">Structure and Policies</h2>

<p><span class="badge bg-info fs-6"><b>Paper Reviews</b></span>: You are required to submit a brief review for the required reading in each class. 
The review must be turned in by <span class="text-danger">at least 12 hours</span> before 
the class. Please read further <a href="reviews.html">instructions</a> on the paper reviews.</p>

<p><span class="badge bg-info fs-6"><b>Participation</b></span>: The structure of this course is unusual in that there are NO lectures. 
Instead, we will discuss research papers that we will have
<em>all read before</em> each class period. Because of this format, class participation
is vital to the success of the course. If you only remain silent in
the class, you will get little out of this course.</p>

<p>In each class, I will ask direct questions about the paper and expect you to
be able to answer. Note that your answers to these questions will be part of
your overall grade.</p>

<p><span class="badge bg-info fs-6"><b>Presentation</b></span>: 
A subset of the papers will be presented by students. The presentation should
be followed by discussions among the entire class led by the presenter. Each
student will present <em>at least once</em> in the semester. We may assign two
students to present one paper when the number of students exceeds the number of
papers to be presented. The presentation will be graded based on the clarity,
completeness, depth, and discussion.</p>

<p><span class="badge bg-info fs-6"><b>Attendance</b></span>: <em>Three</em> absences of
classes are allowed for good reasons (e.g., conference presentation,
interview). However, reviews of the papers must still be turned in.</p>

<p><span class="badge bg-info fs-6"><b>Discussion</b></span>: You are strongly encouraged to discuss the papers with other students in the class â€“ 
  you may have insights that others do not, and vice versa. Often students form reading groups, 
  which I heartily encourage. Note that group discussion, however, is not an effective 
  substitute for actually reading the paper.</p>

<p><span class="badge bg-info fs-6"><b>Project</b></span>: A major component of
this course is a semester-long, research-oriented course project. You will 
work in a team of 2-3 students on the project. This <a href="project.html">page</a> contains
further details on the requirements for the course project.</p>

<p><span class="badge bg-info fs-6"><b>Missing and Late Submission</b></span>: 
You can miss <em>three paper reviews</em> without penalty. A 30% deduction will be applied 
for each missing review beyond the three limit. In other words, missing a total of 
seven paper reviews leads to a 0 for the review grade.</p>

<p>Missing submission of other assignments (proposal, etc.) will receive 0 grade for that assignment.
Late submission of any assignment (paper review, proposal, etc.) receives a late penalty 
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>within 12 hour, 10%</li>
<li>1 day, 20%</li>
<li>2 days, 40%</li>
<li>3 days, 80%</li>
<li>4 days, no credit</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="badge bg-info fs-6"><b>Academic Integrity</b></span>: All students are required to 
  know and adhere to the College of Engineering <a href="https://ecas.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/02/College-of-Engineering-Honor-Code-UPDATED.pdf">Honor Code</a> and 
  university policies. They apply to all course requirements, including the
  paper reviews, proposals, course project code and documentation. <span class="text-danger">Violations of the policies will result
  in serious consequences</span>.</p>
