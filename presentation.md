## Paper Presentation

The student paper presentation is done collaboratively in a group of 2--3
members. Each group will present *at least once* (likely twice) in a
semester. The group members should discuss the paper together to prepare for
the presentation. The slides for the presentation <span class="text-danger">must be 
turned in 24 hours before the class</span>. When you are presenting a paper,
you are not required to submit a review for that paper.

A primary goal of your presentation is to lead the class in a deeper analysis of
the paper. Keep in mind that your audience **has** read the paper.
Therefore, your presentation must go beyond merely summarizing the paper. You should
provide additional insights and contexts, and foster discussions that deepen
everyone's understanding of the topic. <span class="text-danger">Presentation that 
only reiterates the paper content will receive a minimum score</span>.

Specifically, in addition to a brief recap of the paper's motivation and main
ideas, the presentation should:

<ul class="text-primary">
	<li>Provide additional background knowledge not covered in the paper.</li>
	<li>Highlight what points in the paper are important.</li>
	<li>Explain technical details that may be overlooked or that are are difficult to understand.</li>
	<li>Use the optional readings to complement, compare, and contrast with the paper.</li>
	<li>Analyze and critique the evaluation results.</li>
	<li>Identify the strengths and weaknesses of the paper.</li>
	<li>Describe your own reflections, including on potential future research directions.</li>
	<li>Summarize key discussion points for the class.</li>
</ul>

The presentation should be interactive and include questions for the audience.
You should also expect that the audience may interrupt your presentation and
ask questions.

The presentation should last around **25 minutes**, followed by 15 minutes
for discussion. For classes with only one paper to discuss, the presentation
may be extended.

The presentation will be graded based on the clarity, completeness, depth, and
discussion. We will also ask the students in the class to rate each
presentation and provide feedback. The audience rating is counted as part of
your presentation grade.

We expect each group member to contribute fairly to the presentation, and we 
expect to assign the same presentation grade to each member. To
prevent free riding, there will be a peer-evaluation to assess each member's
contributions. Members who contribute less than their fair share will receive 
a lower grade.
